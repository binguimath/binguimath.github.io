##  Research Interests üßê

I am a mathematical analyst working on [vertex operator algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_operator_algebra) (VOAs), a mathematical model of [2d conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_conformal_field_theory). This means that I am interested in analysis problems in VOAs and their representation categories, and that I like to solve VOA problems using analytic methods. These methods can be divided into two parts: 

- Real analysis in unitary VOAs: Using functional analysis and especially [von Neumann algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra), I study the unitarity of VOAs, the unitarity of VOA modules and their fusion products, the relation between VOAs and von Neumann algebras (more precisely: conformal nets).

- Complex analysis in (possibly non-unitary) VOAs: Using complex analysis, I study conformal blocks and their complex-analytic properties, factorization of conformal blocks, C_2 cofinite VOAs and their representations.



<!--I view myself an analyst rather than (say) an algebraist, a geometer, or a topologist. This means that I need less motivational background to study analysis than to study the other branches of mathematics, and that I tend to understand the other branches in an analytic way.-->

## Publications and Preprints üòµ‚Äçüí´

The following are my best research papers. The number preceding each title indicates the year the paper was submitted to arXiv.

See [this page](https://binguimath.github.io/Pages/Publications.html) for the full publications.



2017. Unitarity of The Modular Tensor Categories Associated to Unitary Vertex Operator Algebras, II,  ***Comm. Math. Phys.***, (2019) 372: 893-950. `arXiv:1712.04931` [Preprint](https://binguimath.github.io/Files/2017_UU2.pdf) 
> This is the second (and final) paper in a series where I initiated the systematic study of unitarity in the tensor categories of VOA representations.






2018. Categorical Extensions of Conformal Nets, ***Comm. Math. Phys.***, 383, 763-839 (2021). `arXiv:1812.04470` [Preprint](https://binguimath.github.io/Files/2018_CE.pdf) [Errata](https://binguimath.github.io/Files/Errata/2018_CE_Errata.pdf) (A [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-05-DkG2xc) with [slides](https://binguimath.github.io/Files/2021_Categorical_Extensions_MPPM.pdf))
> This is the first paper studying the equivalence of the representation tensor categories associated to unitary completely rational VOAs and their conformal nets. 


2020. Unbounded Field Operators in Categorical Extensions of Conformal Nets. *First submitted in October 2020, and later to another journal in February 2025.* `arXiv:2001.03095` [Preprint](https://binguimath.github.io/Files/2020_Strong-Braiding.pdf)
> This is the second paper studying the equivalence of representation tensor categories. I solved the conjecture that every unitary affine VOA (i.e. simply-connected WZW model) and its associated loop group conformal net have unitarily equivalent representation tensor categories.


2021. Genus-zero Permutation-twisted Conformal Blocks for Tensor Product Vertex Operator Algebras: The Tensor-factorizable Case, To appear in ***Commun. Contemp. Math.***,  `arXiv:2111.04662`  [Preprint](https://binguimath.github.io/Files/2021_Permutation.pdf)  [Slides](https://binguimath.github.io/Files/2022_BIMSA.pdf)
> Although this paper focuses on VOAs, its motivation originates from conformal nets and operator algebras. One of its main goals is to address the question: Why are conformal nets, which are defined and studied in the genus-zero setting, capable of describing higher-genus chiral CFTs? The answer lies in what I refer to as the "permutation-twisted/untwisted correspondence": genus-zero permutation-twisted chiral CFTs correspond to higher-genus untwisted CFTs via branched coverings. This observation represents, in my view, a significant contribution of operator algebra theory to the understanding of VOAs. Unfortunately, the importance of this correspondence has not been widely recognized within the VOA community.


2025. (Joint with [Hao Zhang](https://zhanghao1999math.github.io/homepage/)) Analytic Conformal Blocks of C2-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems. `arXiv:2503.23995` [Preprint](https://binguimath.github.io/Files/2025_CB3.pdf).

See [this page](https://binguimath.github.io/Pages/2023_Analysis_Old.html) for some older versions of the lecture notes.

> These are the lecture notes for my [course](Courses/Course_2022_VOA.md) ***Vertex Operator Algebras, Conformal Blocks, and Tensor Categories*** given at Yau Mathematical Sciences Center in 2022 Spring.


- [Spectral Theory for Strongly Commuting Normal Closed Operators](Files/2021_Spectral.pdf) 


> We give a detailed and self-contained exposition of the topics indicated in the title of this monograph. I origianally planned to give a course "Unbounded Operators in Conformal Field Theories" at Yau Mathematical Sciences Center in 2022 Spring, but have since changed the course topic to VOAs and conformal blocks. This monograph is the outcome of the preparation of that course.  

- [Conformal Blocks: Vector Bundle Structures, Sewing, and Factorization](Files/2020_Conformal_Blocks.pdf) 


> In this monograph we give a complex-analytic approach to the theory of conformal blocks for VOAs. Part of this note has been adapted to form the main body of my article *Convergence of Sewing Conformal Blocks*. The section on (multi) propagation of conformal blocks has been expanded and explained in more details in the article *Sewing and Propagation of Conformal Blocks*.
