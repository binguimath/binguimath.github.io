##  Research Interests üßê

I am a mathematical analyst working on [vertex operator algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_operator_algebra) (VOAs), a mathematical model of [2d conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_conformal_field_theory). This means that I am interested in analysis problems in VOAs and their representation categories, and that I like to solve VOA problems using analytic methods. These methods can be divided into two parts: 

- Real analysis in unitary VOAs: Using functional analysis and especially [von Neumann algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra), I study the unitarity of VOAs, the unitarity of VOA modules and their fusion products, the relation between VOAs and von Neumann algebras (more precisely: conformal nets).

- Complex analysis in (possibly non-unitary) VOAs: Using complex analysis, I study conformal blocks and their complex-analytic properties, factorization of conformal blocks, C_2 cofinite VOAs and their representations.



<!--I view myself an analyst rather than (say) an algebraist, a geometer, or a topologist. This means that I need less motivational background to study analysis than to study the other branches of mathematics, and that I tend to understand the other branches in an analytic way.-->
