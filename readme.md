##  Research Interests

I'm interested in the mathematical areas that are related to two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory, including:  Algebraic Quantum (Conformal) Field Theory, Vertex Operator Algebras, Subfactors and Von Neumann Algebras, Tensor Categories.

I consider myself a half-operator algebraist  and half-vertex algebraist. I'm especially interested in the interplay between the operator algebraic (more precisely speaking, von Neumann algebraic)  and the vertex algebraic approaches to 2d conformal field theory.

## Notes

- [Conformal Blocks: Vector Bundle Structures, Sewing, and Factorization](Files/2020_Conformal_Blocks.pdf) 


> In this monograph we give a complex-analytic approach to the theory of conformal blocks for VOAs. Part of this note has been adapted to form the main body of my article *Convergence of Sewing Conformal Blocks*. The section on (multi) propagation of conformal blocks has been expanded and explained in more details in the article *Sewing and Propagation of Conformal Blocks*.

- [Spectral Theory for Strongly Commuting Normal Closed Operators](Files/2021_Spectral.pdf) 


> We give a detailed and self-contained exposition of the topics indicated in the title of this monograph.
