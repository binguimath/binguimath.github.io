##  Research Interests üßê

I am a mathematical analyst working on [vertex operator algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_operator_algebra) (VOAs), a mathematical model of [2d conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_conformal_field_theory). This means that I am interested in analysis problems in VOAs and their representation categories, and that I like to solve VOA problems using analytic methods. These methods can be divided into two parts: 

- Real analysis in unitary VOAs: Using functional analysis and especially [von Neumann algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra), I study the unitarity of VOAs, the unitarity of VOA modules and their fusion products, the relation between VOAs and von Neumann algebras (more precisely: conformal nets).

- Complex analysis in (possibly non-unitary) VOAs: Using complex analysis, I study conformal blocks and their complex-analytic properties, factorization of conformal blocks, C_2 cofinite VOAs and their representations.



<!--I view myself an analyst rather than (say) an algebraist, a geometer, or a topologist. This means that I need less motivational background to study analysis than to study the other branches of mathematics, and that I tend to understand the other branches in an analytic way.-->

## Notes ü•±

- [Conformal Blocks: Vector Bundle Structures, Sewing, and Factorization](Files/2020_Conformal_Blocks.pdf) 


> In this monograph we give a complex-analytic approach to the theory of conformal blocks for VOAs. Part of this note has been adapted to form the main body of my article *Convergence of Sewing Conformal Blocks*. The section on (multi) propagation of conformal blocks has been expanded and explained in more details in the article *Sewing and Propagation of Conformal Blocks*.

- [Spectral Theory for Strongly Commuting Normal Closed Operators](Files/2021_Spectral.pdf) 


> We give a detailed and self-contained exposition of the topics indicated in the title of this monograph. I origianally planned to give a course "Unbounded Operators in Conformal Field Theories" at Yau Mathematical Sciences Center in 2022 Spring, but have since changed the course topic to VOAs and conformal blocks. This monograph is the outcome of the preparation of that course.

- [Lectures on Vertex Operator Algebras and Conformal Blocks](Files/2022_VOA_Lectures.pdf)

> These are the lecture notes for my course [Vertex Operator Algebras, Conformal Blocks, and Tensor Categories](Course_2022_VOA.md)  given at Yau Mathematical Sciences Center in 2022 Spring.
