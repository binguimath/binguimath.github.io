##  Research Interests üßê

I am a mathematical analyst working on [vertex operator algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_operator_algebra) (VOAs), a mathematical model of [2d conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_conformal_field_theory). This means that I am interested in analysis problems in VOAs and their representation categories, and that I like to solve VOA problems using analytic methods. These methods can be divided into two parts: 

- Real analysis in unitary VOAs: Using functional analysis and especially [von Neumann algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra), I study the unitarity of VOAs, the unitarity of VOA modules and their fusion products, the relation between VOAs and von Neumann algebras (more precisely: conformal nets).

- Complex analysis in (possibly non-unitary) VOAs: Using complex analysis, I study conformal blocks and their complex-analytic properties, factorization of conformal blocks, C_2 cofinite VOAs and their representations.



<!--I view myself an analyst rather than (say) an algebraist, a geometer, or a topologist. This means that I need less motivational background to study analysis than to study the other branches of mathematics, and that I tend to understand the other branches in an analytic way.-->

> We completely solve the problem of formulating and proving a factorization theorem for finite logarithmic chiral CFTs. In particular, our result naturally connects with the topological modular functors. Prior to our work, factorization had been established mainly for rational chiral CFTs, while for finite logarithmic chiral CFTs, no existing work had successfully proven a factorization result that aligns with the perspectives from TQFT and tensor categories, even in low-genus cases such as genus one.

> Although this paper focuses on VOAs, its motivation originates from conformal nets and operator algebras. One of its main goals is to address the question: Why are conformal nets, which are defined and studied in the genus-0 setting, capable of describing higher-genus chiral CFTs? The answer lies in what I refer to as the "permutation-twisted/untwisted correspondence": genus-0 permutation-twisted chiral CFTs correspond to higher-genus untwisted chiral CFTs via branched coverings. This observation represents, in my view, a significant contribution of operator algebras to the understanding of VOAs. Unfortunately, the importance of this correspondence has yet to be widely recognized within the VOA community.

> As an application, this paper gives the first complete computation of permutation-twisted fusion rules in terms of untwisted fusion rules for C2-cofinite rational VOAs.
