# 2024 Fall, Topics in Operator Algebras: Algebraic Conformal Field Theory


## Course description

In this course, we study 2d conformal field theory (CFT) in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT). In AQFT, a quantum field theory is formulated as a family of operator algebras acting on a fixed Hilbert space H satisfying certain axioms. In this setting, we will construct rigorous models of 2d chiral CFT. Our first main goals are to give rigorous proofs the CPT symmetry for these models, the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem (which relate the dilation symmetry and the CPT symmetry to the Tomita-Takesaki theorem of von Neumann algebras), and the Haag duality.
