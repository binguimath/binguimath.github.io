# Biography

I was born in 1991 in Shanghai, China. 


## Academic Experiences
- (2021.9-)  Assistant Professor, Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University
- (2018.9-2021.6)  Postdoc (Hill Assistant Professor), Math Department, Rutgers University-New Brunswick. Mentor: Yi-Zhi Huang

## Education
- (2013.8-2018.6) Ph.D., Math Department, Vanderbilt University. Advisor: Vaughan Jones. Thesis: *A Unitary Tensor Product Theory for Unitary Vertex Operator Algebra Modules*
> Note: This is just a compilation of a series of two papers I have published: *Unitarity of The Modular Tensor Categories Associated to Unitary Vertex Operator Algebras, I&II*. So don't waste your time looking for my thesis. You won't find much new except for my support of Sci-Hub in the acknowledgements section.🤣
- (2009.9-2013.6) B.S., Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiaotong University. Advisors: Jin Liang（梁进）, Yijun Yao（姚一隽）. Thesis: *Rigidity Theory of von Neumann Algebras*
> Note: This thesis is more or less a reading note. My mathematical interest changed after I graduated from university. So now I have forgotten everything about the von Neumann rigidity theory.🤪
- (2006.9-2009.6) Shanghai Fuxing senior high school
