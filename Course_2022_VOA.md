## Course Description:
Vertex operator algebras (VOAs) are mathematical objects describing 2d chiral conformal field theory. The representation category of a “strongly rational” VOA is a modular tensor category (which yields a 3d topological quantum field theory), and conjecturally, all modular tensor categories arise from such VOA representations. Conformal blocks are the crucial ingredients in the representation theory of VOAs.

This course is an introduction to the basic theory of VOAs, their representations, and conformal blocks from the complex analytic point of view. Our goal in the first half of this course is to get familiar with the computations in VOA theory and some basic examples. The second half is devoted to the study of conformal blocks. The goal is to understand the following three crucial properties of conformal blocks and the roles they play in the representation categories of VOAs. (1) The spaces of conformal blocks form a vector bundle with (projectively flat) connections. (2) Sewing conformal blocks is convergent (3) Factorization property.



## Prerequisites
(Many instructors say in a topic course that the only prerequisites are the basics of "A", though the actual ones are a firm understanding of "ABCDE". In the following, I am trying to be as honest as possible.)
* Complex analysis
* You should be familiar with the materials taught in any course or textbook called "Differential Manifolds". You should also know the definition of its complex analog: complex manifolds. 
* You should have some rough idea of how the representations of Lie algebras and Lie groups are related.

References for conformal blocks

* Khono, Conformal Field Theory and Topology, §1. (My favorite introductory book on conformal blocks. Brief and concise. Assumes little background knowledge.)

* Tsuchiya-Kanie, Vertex operators in conformal field theory on P^1 and monodromy representations of braid group. (Very classical paper. Also assumes little background knowledge, although some of the terminology and methods are a bit outdated. Conformal blocks are called “primary fields” in this paper.)

> Our course could be viewed as a friendly introduction to the topics in this monograph. When studying these topics, we will make simplifications when possible. For instance, some results will be proved only for the genus 0 surface so that everything can be worked out using basic complex analysis.

The following references require a solid background in algebraic geometry, which we do NOT require in our course.
