# Learning Notes

Disclaimer: These are the notes I took when I was studying the topics on my own. This means that I was a novice when writing these notes (and I may still be a novice to this day), and that these notes may contain stupid mistakes and poor understanding of the topics.


- [Learning Notes on Complex Analytic Geometry](Files/2022_CAG.pdf)
 > These notes were written for my self-study of complex analytic geometry. My goal was to understand the proofs of semiconituity theorem and base change theorems for complex analytic spaces.
