- TA: 刘晗  秦楷

- Office hour: By appointment.
  
- Office location: Shuangqing Complex Building (Block A) C648  (双清综合楼A座C648 双清食堂对面)
  
- Grades: 25% Homework + 30% Midterm + 45% Final
  
- Homework: Both Chinese and English can be used for writing homework.  Your homework solutions should be combined into a single (pdf) file and submitted online to Web Learning-Work (网络学堂-课程作业). **Do not upload more than one file**, because this will make it more difficult for the TA to grade the assignment. You can easily find online tools for merging pdf files such as [this one](https://www.ilovepdf.com/merge_pdf).
