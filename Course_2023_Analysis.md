# 2023 Fall & 2024 Spring, Analysis I II


## Course description

This is a year-long course for first year students in the Qiuzhen College of Tsinghua University. This is also my second time teaching this course. I plan to teach most of the same topics as last year, with some minor adaptions, rearragements, and (hopefully) improvements. So you can check the following lecture notes (in Chinese) to get a general idea about what might be taught in this class. 

I will also type English lecture notes this year. See the link below.
