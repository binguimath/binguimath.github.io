# 2023 Fall & 2024 Spring, Analysis I & II


## Course description

This is a year-long course for first year undergraduate students in the Qiuzhen College of Tsinghua University. This is also my second time teaching this course. I plan to teach most of the same topics as last year, but with some minor adjustments, rearragements, and (hopefully) improvements. So you can check the Chinese lecture notes on this page to get a general idea about what might be taught in this class. 




## English lecture notes

The following lecture notes are the main reference for this course. 

- [Qiuzhen Lectures on Analysis](Files/2023_Analysis.pdf) (in progress)
> Please let me know if you find any typos or mistakes. This will help me improve the notes!

I will cover Chapter 1 very quickly (or even skip this chapter) in class. So I recommend that you take a look at Chapter 1 to make sure you know these topics: unions and intersections of families of sets, functions, partial and total orders, equivalence relations, cardinality, countable sets, real numbers are uncountable, etc.

## Chinese lecture notes taken in the former semesters

These notes are written by students taking my class in 2022 Fall and 2023 Spring.
